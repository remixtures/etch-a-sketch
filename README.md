A "Etch A Sketch" type of app inspired by something I saw on one of Wes Bos courses ("Beginner JavaScript") but with a few modifications in terms of CSS and typography. The result is something between a Chuck Close painting and a acid trip. The app makes use of an #HTML5 element named canvas. To draw lines with the colors of the rainbow, move the arrow keys of your keyboard. To clear the canvas, click on the "Shake!" button. Enjoy!! ðŸ˜ƒ
